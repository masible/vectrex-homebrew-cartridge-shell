# Vectrex Homebrew Cartridge Shell

Remix of [Vectrex Cartridge Case](https://www.printables.com/model/125566-vectrex-cartridge-case)
modified to better accommodate RetroElectronik homebrew cartridge PCBs
and WireOut-RE.

The original version of the bottom shell did not fit my copy of
[Wireout-RE](http://www.futurevector.eu/Wireout-re.html) at all (PCB too long,
and pegs too big), or the r2tronik test cartridge.
